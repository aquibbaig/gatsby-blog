Learn why I decided to bring down my blog written in symfony and switched to GatsbyJS.
I had written my first blog in Symfony and remade it again. Doing this would take me about 5-6 hours. And it was really hectic
to add some new bundle/functionalities to it. But while coming across
new JavaScript libraries, GatsbyJS caught my attention. Also, while static site generators such as Jekyll, Gatsby, etc. are getting more popular,
I thought why not use it myself. 

> Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. It is a static site generator.

As I had mentioned about duration, building a blog in symfony took me about 4-5 days plus one more day in setup/deploy.
Here I am with GatsbyJS and it took me about 45 minutes to fetch a starter template and get it up and runnning! That's what 
gatsby can do for you folks!

### What can Gatsby do for you

- The most powerful introduction for the year 2018 in the JavaScript world.
- With the introduction of webpack 4, React 16, and Babel 7, Gatsby now does even more optimizations under the hood. The stats are pretty amazing: the overall client side bundle shrank by 31%.
- Vast multitude of plugins. Gatsby has the most abundant collection of important plugins that facilitate functionalities prior to SEO, react-helmet, filesystem, sitemap, typography, netlify, GraphQL and a maybe jillion more. [Plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/)
- GraphQL integration let's you query data and it has a serverless static archtiechture which is easier to manage and build.
- Bounce Rates, Lead Conversion and Revenue
- One of the best developer and user experience using `build` and `develop` environment just a command away.
