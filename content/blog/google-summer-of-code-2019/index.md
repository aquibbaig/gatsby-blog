### Introduction
I feel really happy to announce that I have been selected to work under 
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) internship programme organised every year by Google Inc. to 
make students reach out to Open Source organisations and provide them a wonderful opportunity to grow as Open Source 
developers. This year, the programme is going to start from May 27, 2019 to August 19, 2019. The best thing about this 
programme is that firstly, it is work from home and secondly, on successfully completing it, Google pays you a hefty stipend.
This is supposed to vary from country to country [as mentioned here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends).
I hope to work really hard and satisfy all those goals that I have proposed.

> This summer can be a uphill task for me because my semester clashes with GSoC dates but whateven. No life without them challenges!

### About my Organisation
[FOSSi foundation](https://fossi-foundation.org/) is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent group. FOSSi Foundation was created by a group of individuals coming from industry and academia, each with long experience in working on prominent Open Source projects within the digital design and embedded areas. The foundation is managed by directors, formed by the members and backed by sponsors.

### About my project
Turns out I will be working on the project [Librecores](https://www.librecores.org) to develop it in terms of **user interactivity** and **feedback**. It is a website designed with **Php** *(Symfony framework)*. A ***LibreCore*** is such an IP core that is created and distributed in the open source spirit. And LibreCores.org is like a good neighborhood pub, a place to meet the community and most importantly, find such cores. Currently it fetches data about a project from Github and it has a definitive search experience for discovering such IP Cores.
I started looking at their codebase since early November and contributing shortly after.
My mentor for the project is **Phillip Wagner**, who is a very friendly guy - 
I had no idea about Symfony when I started contributing and he was always helpful in every task that I had undergone.

### What I am willing to achieve this summer
The abstract for my project can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4914571964317696/#5913738987700224).
The entire project of mine can be broken down into **three** major parts
- For first evaluation: Design and Implement a **Notification System**.
- For second evaluation: Design a system to record **User Feedback** on projects listed on Librecores.
- Strech goal: Improve UI libraries(such as migration to **webpack**).

### Conclusion
Me and my mentor **Philipp** are having discussions for implementation of the above goals and I am looking forward to working 40+ hours  and adhering to my timeline as mentioned in my proposal. I am excited and yet nervous for this opportunity that lies in front of me. 

**Peace!**
