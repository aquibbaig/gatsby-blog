- Someday I thought, I would find the one

who would consider my ideas important.

Who will push me as far as I would go,

And will take the pain away as much as I know.

- Pillars as they are built to stay forever,

Who's yours in this world of valour?

Proving one's might as they go on,

Losing one's soul has anyone ever known?

- Sometimes we all feel secluded and sad,

Over things that don't fall into place,

But what if you feel just empty within

Just a skeleton and no soul these days!

- That's when you realise important facts,

When they don't care neither should you,

In a world full of friends,

You are a void of all the few.

- Your heart is not special,

A small emotionless engine of blood oil

But who will capture the little sparks of your mind

Those demons you fear to confront even from behind?

- Sometimes I laugh and cry immediately,

A moment of happiness reminds me of my sad days

It feels good when people laugh at your jokes

But what if you're too numb to laugh at your own?

- Everyone has dreams, nobody wants to fail

Why does everyone look for someone

Who has a similar state

But all he cares about is his own fate!! #friends

- People will ask you for suggestions

And will throw your suggestions into garbage

How do you give advices to anyone?

You yourself are a piece of shit of the dark age

- Why is it that I hate myself

Maybe I am not the person I admired once

You urge to leave while you are too stubborn to stay


- What if it doesn't rhyme

Like who cares?

My feelings are transparent

All the way from inside across all the emotion layers

- My work is over, whom shall I call? 

I look back and no one is here, 

everyone got issues, why add another one to their list

Are you too afraid to handle your own sh*t?

- So, these days I'm just all alone

Nobody to turn to, nothing that I own,

With my thoughts and feelings 

In a prison full of lifeless cielings.


## Conclusion
```
Nobody will understand, and nobody will support your decisions ever. You failed, they won't back you up
when it's not alright. Parents are too old and stubborn to handle your problems. They
did try to solve them for you but now you're just a useless virus who always needs a host
to cling to - so dependable. You once thought you knew yourself but all these results
make you realise what you think is wrong. So what do you do? Do you change yourself to succeed 
or do you stay the same as yourself? But firstly who's you? I don't know who I am or who I have
turned. Also, what do you do?
